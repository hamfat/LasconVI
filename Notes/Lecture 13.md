Simulators
----------

 * NEURON: Most used one
 * GENESIS or MOOSE (Indian Fork, with a lot of progress)
 * PSICS: Stochastic ion channel models
 * NEST: Simulator designed for large neural networks, optimized for parallel computing.
 * Brian Simulator: Python module
 * Auryn: High speed simulator, designed for large time scale simulations.
 * Topographica simulator: models of firing-rate point neurons.
 * NeMo: high-performance spinking neural network simulator (designed for PyNN and GPUs)
 * GeNN: GPU designed Frameworks
 * Nengo: high-level large-cale neural systems simulator, has a browser interface.
 * MCell: monte carlo reaction diffusion modeling


 Databases
 ---------

 * NeuroMorpho: 30,000 neuron cells (.swc)
 * ModelDB

Tools
-----

 * TREES Toolbox
 * CX3D: Growth of cortex in 2D
 * NeuGen: Generation of neuronal morphologies and neural networks in 3D

Interoperability Frameworks
---------------------------

 * neuroConstruct
 * PyNN: Python API for creating neural network simulations
 * NeuroML: model description language
 * MUSIC: Allow neuronal simulator to exchange data in runtime

Other
-----

* OCNS
* INCF
* Mailing lists: connectionists and comp-neuro
* Open Source Brain Initiative
