Qualitative Analysis of Dynamical Systems for Neuroscience (Part 4)
=======================

Hysteresis
----------

Starts and stop firing in different values of a parameter (usually the current). This happens when we have bistability.

Bursting
--------

Tonic spiking surrounded by silence or sub-threshold oscillations. Physically, firing can be interrupted by voltage-gated channels and Ca-gated channes. More details in the slide.
