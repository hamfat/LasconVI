Qualitative Analysis of Dynamical Systems for Neuroscience (Part 2)
=======================

Dynamics in 2d
--------------

In this case, we have equations defining dx/dt and dy/dt. Two equations of interest are dx/dt=0 and dy/dt=0 (Nullclines). The x* is defined as the vector where both of them are zero.

The stability is given by the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix at x*. These eigenvalues can be reaal or complex. For real eigenvalues, the point is stable only if they are negative (because we have e^(\lambda t)). If complex, the stability is given by the real part of the eigenvalue.

The det and the trace of the Jacobian Matrix determine if the point is stable or unstable (see the slide with the diagram).
