Ionic Channels and their properties
===================================

Structure
---------

In the hodgkin-huxley model, we have channel activation and deactivation variables that may give us insights on their properties. The values of V such that these variables are both different from zero is called the activation window.

Patch clamps gives us information about individual ionic channels, that can be then averaged, so we have smoother curves. Pharmacology also gives us the power to block some of these channels (e.g. local anesthesics like lidocaine). The structure of these channels can be inferred with the use of pharmacology.

K Channels are diverse and Na channels are less diverse. Na, K and Ca channels form a gene superfamily. Ca channels are a single protein, while Na and K ones have several segments. All channels are heavily archored to intracellular proteins. In the slides we have several figures of those channels.

There are several opening and inactivation mechanisms.  

Functions
---------
- Leak channels
- Voltage-gated channels
- Ligant-gated channels
- Gap junction channels
- Transporters and pumps

Some channels (like Ca-dependent K channels), can enable spike frequency adaaptation and bursting or even computations like XOR operations (Zador et al 1992) - enough Ca influx can disable K channels and prevents firing. Others (like high-voltage-activated Ca channels) have a major role in matabolism.

Other specific function of Ion channels are found at this lecture's slides.

Mutations that affects ionic channels usually lead to diseases.

Markov models
-------------

Kinect model with channel states that undergo first order transitions. Hodgkin-Huxley model can be represented as Markov models.

Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz current equation
-------------------------------------

Hodgkin-Huxley model assumes linear instantaneous current-voltage relations like I = g_s (V - E_s).

Some properties of Ca ions lead to non-linear I-V instantaneous relation that can be modeld by GHK equation.
