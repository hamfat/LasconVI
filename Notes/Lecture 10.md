Dendritic Computation
=====================

How the neurons decide when to spike? In this class,we will examine the influence of dendritic morphology in the propagation of signals.

We know (Stuart & Sakmann 1994) that there is a backpropagation of action potentials. Looking at the slides, we see that the threshold is lower somewhere close to the soma. There is also variability between cell type in this respect. The morphology may be responsible for this variability. The density of the channels can modulate the AP amplitude as well, and how these affects the cell depends on the morphology.

We can construct a reduced cable model from a branched neuron, encoding the branches as difference in diameter of the cable (see slides). These models can predict backpropagation with high reliability.


Coupling between somatic and dendritic AP initiation sites
-----------------------------------------------------

Stimulating the soma at the same time as the dendrite can produce calcium spikes in different times from,say, dendritic stimulus alone.

The morphology affects this coupling. Proximal branches on the dendrite don't affects backpropagation, while distal branches reduces it.
