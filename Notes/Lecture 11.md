Realistic Modeling of Neuronal Circuits
=======================================

*The construction of Golgi Cell model*

Initially a reduced model with one compartment is created. The temperature have to be corrected before the simulation. Then, the excitability need to adjusted.

Absence of current injection => Activity
Presencce of current injection => Frequency modulation

A 3D model of a thousand cells is built, where we provide Mossy fibre input. Close golgi cells gives inhibitory input.
